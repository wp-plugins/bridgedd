BridgeDD creates a stable, resource-light bridge between WordPress and phpBB3.

== Description ==

BridgeDD is a WordPress&harr;phpBB bridge that...works.

You can log in and out from WordPress or phpBB as you always do, and you will be automatically logged in/out of both applications. When someone registers to become a member, they automatically become a member of both applications. There is no need to worry about "integrating" existing members into both applications - BridgeDD handles it automatically.

And best of all, the bridging is done using a breakthrough technology that eliminates the bloat, sluggishness, and bugs of other WordPress-based bridge plugins and phpBB-based bridge MODs.

You can obtain support by visiting the [**BridgeDD support board**](http://www.diondesigns.org/bridgedd/support/index.php) (phpBB, of course!). Becoming a member on the support board will give you access to BridgeDD Premium, an accessory plugin that provides basic cross-posting capabilities as well as a recent-topics widget. Members can also ask support questions.

Those who become a BridgeDD Subscriber will gain access to a private forum where you can download **BridgeDD PRO**, the bridge everyone has been waiting for! You will be able to add your WordPress header, footer, and widgets directly into your phpBB templates *without loading WordPress*, giving you the ability to create a lightweight, seamless bridge.

== Installation ==

1. If a bridge plugin is installed, deactivate it
2. In a separate tab/window, log in to phpBB with your admin/founder account
3. Upload the _bridgedd.zip_ file via the Install Plugins interface
4. Activate the BridgeDD plugin
5. Enter the server path where your phpBB installation is located

BridgeDD will automatically integrate your two accounts. You can then close the tab/window to phpBB.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The path to phpBB doesn't work. Why? =
The path must be server-based and not a URL. BridgeDD automatically provides the initial (difficult) part of this path.

= I entered the correct path to phpBB, but BridgeDD doesn't work. Why? =
The WordPress and phpBB installations must be in the same domain. BridgeDD will not work if, for example, WordPress is installed at **http://mydomain.com** and phpBB is installed at **http://forum.mydomain.com**

= Got more questions? =
